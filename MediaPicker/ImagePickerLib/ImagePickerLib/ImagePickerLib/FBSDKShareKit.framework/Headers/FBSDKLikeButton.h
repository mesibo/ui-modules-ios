 @abstract A button to like an object.
 @discussion Tapping the receiver will invoke an API call to the Facebook app through a fast-app-switch that allows
 the object to be liked.  Upon return to the calling app, the view will update with the new state.  If the
 currentAccessToken has "publish_actions" permission and the object is an Open Graph object, then the like can happen
 seamlessly without the fast-app-switch.
